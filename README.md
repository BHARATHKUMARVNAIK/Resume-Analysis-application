# ðŸ§  Resume Screening System using NLP & Machine Learning

This project is a web-based application that automatically classifies resumes into job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Built with Streamlit, it allows users to upload resumes (PDF or DOCX) and receive instant predictions based on trained models.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload resumes in PDF or DOCX format
- Clean and preprocess text using custom NLP pipeline
- Predict job category using trained ML models (SVM, Random Forest)
- User-friendly web interface with Streamlit
- Trained on a labeled resume dataset

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
